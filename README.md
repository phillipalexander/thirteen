# thirteen
#### (13, XIII, 十三, trece, tredici, तेरह, ثلاثة عشر, тринадцать, treze, dreizehn, baker's dozen, 11012)

Take any number (or anything that _thinks_ it's a number)
and multiply by [thirteen][13].

From [Wikipedia][13]:
> 13 (thirteen /θɜrˈtiːn/) is the natural number following 12 and preceding 14.

> In spoken English, the numbers 13 and 30 are often confused. When carefully enunciated, they differ in which syllable is stressed: 13 Listeni/θərˈtiːn/ vs. 30 /ˈθɜrti/. However, in dates such as 1300 ("thirteen hundred") or when contrasting numbers in the teens, such as 13, 14, 15, the stress shifts to the first syllable: 13 /ˈθɜrtiːn/.
