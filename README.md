Take any number (or anything that _thinks_ it's a number)
and multiply by [thirteen][13].

From [Wikipedia][13]:
> 13 (thirteen /θɜrˈtiːn/) is the natural number following 12 and preceding 14.

> In spoken English, the numbers 13 and 30 are often confused. When carefully enunciated, they differ in which syllable is stressed: 13 [![Listen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Speakerlink-new.svg/22px-Speakerlink-new.svg.png)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/En-us-thirteen.ogg) [/θərˈtiːn/][not13] vs. 30 [/ˈθɜrti/][not13]. However, in dates such as 1300 ("thirteen hundred") or when contrasting numbers in the teens, such as 13, 14, 15, the stress shifts to the first syllable: 13 [/ˈθɜrtiːn/][not13].
